Etch a Sketch Project

The project showcases the use of DOM manipulation to create a website that acts as an old etch-a-sketch. The website contains features that change the canvas size, the color of the brush, and the ability to completely reset the canvas.

The project can be found [here.](https://justynrad.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)
